A strategy that fails to define a variety of plausible and feasible immediate actions is missing a critical component. 

Executives who complain about "execution" problems have usually confused strategy with goal setting. When the "strategy" process is basically a game of setting performance goals - so much market share and so much profit, so many students graduating high school, so many visitors to the museum - then there remains a yawning gap between these ambitions and action. Strategy is about _how_ and organization will move forward. Doing strategy is figuring out _how_ to advance the organization's interests.

A good strategy has an essential logical structure that I call the _kernel._ The kernel of a strategy contains three elements: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action. The guiding policy specifies the approach to dealing with the obstacles called out in the diagnosis. It is like a signpost, marking the direction forward but not defining the details of the trip. Coherent actions are feasible coordinated policies, resource commitments, and actions designed to carry out the guiding policy.

To detect a bad strategy, look for one of its four major hallmarks:
* **Fluff.** Fluff is a form of gibberish masquerading as strategic concepts or arguments. It uses "Sunday" words (words that are inflated and unnecessarily abstruse) and apparently esoteric concepts to create the illusion of high-level thinking.
* **Failure to face the challenge.** Bad strategy fails to recognize or define the challenge. When you cannot define the challenge, you cannot evaluate a strategy or improve it.
* **Mistaking goals for strategy.** Many bad strategies are just statements of desire rather than plans for overcoming obstacles.
* **Bad strategic objectives.** A strategic objective is set by a leader as a means to an end. Strategic objectives are "bad" when they fail to address critical issues or when they are impracticable.

In Europe, motivational speakers are not the staple on the management lecture circuit that they are in the United States, where the doctrine of leadership as motivation is alive and well. Here, for example, is H. Ross Perot: "Most people give up just when they're about to achieve success. They quit on the one-yard line. They give up at the last minute of the game, one foot from a winning touchdown."

Hearing this, many Americans nod in agreement. Many Europeans, by contrast, hear the echo of the "one last push" at Passchendaele. There, the slaughtered troops did not suffer from a lack of motivation. They suffered from a lack of competent strategic leadership. Motivation is an essential part of life and success, and a leader may justly ask for "one last push," but the leader's job is more than that. The job of the leader is also to create the conditions that will make that push effective, to have a strategy worthy of the effort called upon.

The kernel of a strategy contains three elements:
1. A _diagnosis_ that defines or explains the nature of the challenge. A good diagnosis simplifies the often overwhelming complexity of reality by identifying certain aspects of the situation as critical. 
1. A _guiding policy_ for dealing with the challenge. This is an overall approach chosen to cope with or overcome the obstacles identified in the diagnosis. 
1. A set of _coherent actions_ that are designed to carry out the guiding policy. These are steps that are coordinated with one another to work together in accomplishing the guiding policy.

Here are some examples:
* For a doctor, the challenge appears as a set of signs and symptoms together with a history. The doctor makes a clinical diagnosis, naming a disease or pathology. The therapeutic approach chosen is the doctor's guiding policy. The doctor's specific prescriptions for diet, therapy, and medication are the set of coherent actions to be taken.
* Inn business, the challenge is usually dealing with change and competition. The first step toward effective strategy is diagnosing the specific structure of the challenge rather than simply naming performance goals. The second step is choosing an overall guiding policy for dealing with the situation that builds on or creates some type of leverage or advantage. The third step is the design of a configuration of actions and resource allocations that implement the chosen guiding policy.

#### Page 84: ###
The guiding policy outlines an overall approach for overcoming the obstacles highlighted by the diagnosis. It is "guiding" because it channels action in certain directions without defining exactly what shall be done. ...

A guiding policy creates advantage by _anticipating_ the actions and reactions of others, by _reducing the complexity and ambiguity_ in the situation, by exploiting the _leverage_ inherent in concentrating effort on a pivotal or decisive aspect of the situation, and by creating policies and actions that are _coherent_ each building on the other rather than canceling one another out.

The idea that coordination, by itself, can be a source of advantage is a very deep principle. It is often underappreciated because people tend to think of coordination in terms of continuing mutual adjustments among agents. Strategic coordination, or coherence, is not ad hoc mutual adjustment. It is coherence imposed on a system by policy and design. ...

But decentralized decision making cannot do everything. In particular, it may fail when either the costs or benefits of actions are not borne by the decentralized actors. The split between the costs and benefits may occur across organizational units or between the present and the future. And decentralized coordination is difficult when benefits accrue only if decisions are properly coordinated. Of course, centrally designed policies can also fail if the decision makers are foolish, in the pay of special interest groups, or simply choose incorrectly.

Like the Surveyor design teams, every organization faces a situation where the full complexity and ambiguity of the situation is daunting. An important duty of any leader is to absorb a large part of that complexity and ambiguity, passing on to the organization a simpler problem - one that is solvable. Many leaders fail badly at this responsibility, announcing ambitious goals without resolving a good chunk of ambiguity about the specific obstacles to be overcome. To take responsibility is more than a willingness to accept the blame. It is setting proximate objectives and handing the organization a problem it can actually solve. ...

The more dynamic the situation, the poorer your foresight will be. Therefore, the more uncertain and dynamic the situation, the more _proximate_ a strategic objective must be. The proximate objective is guided by forecasts of the future, but the more uncertain the future, the more its essential logic is that of "taking a strong position and creating options," not of looking far ahead.

In the same way [as a scientific hypothesis], a good business strategy deals with the edge between the known and the unknown. Again, it is competition with others that pushes us to the edges of knowledge. Only there are found the opportunities to keep ahead of rivals. There is no avoiding it. That uneasy sense of ambiguity you feel is real. It is the scent of opportunity.

"Young man," said Carnegie, squinting dubiously at the consultant, "if you can tell me something about management that is worth hearing, I will send you a check for ten thousand dollars."

Now, ten thousand dollars was a great deal of money in 1890. Conversation stopped as the people nearby turned to hear what Taylor would say. 

"Mr. Carnegie," Taylor said, "I would advise you to make a list of the ten most important things you can do. And then, start doing number one."

And, the story goes, a week later Taylor received a check for ten thousand dollars. ...

Later that night, I saw that there was aa deeper truth in the story. Carnegie's benefit was not from the list itself. It came from actually constructing the list.

The problem is that there might be better ideas out there, just beyond the edge of our vision. But we accept early closure because letting go of a judgement is painful and disconcerting. To search for a new insight, one would have to put aside the the comfort of being oriented and once again cast around in choppy waters for a new source of stability. There is the fear of coming up empty-handed. Plus, it is unnatural, even painful, to question our own ideas. ...

What follows are a few techniques that I have found useful in jogging minds loose from their ruts, for helping to check that strategies have some coherence, and for improving your ability to make judgements as well as critique them. 
* The Kernel - the kernel is a list reminding us that a good strategy has, at a minimum, three essential components: a _diagnosis_ of the situation, the choice of an overall _guiding policy_, and the design of _coherent action._
* Problem-Solution - Many attempts at strategy lack a good diagnosis. Hence, it is useful to have mental tools for working backward from a guiding policy to the realm of diagnosis and fact.
* Create-Destroy - Overcoming quick closure is simple in principle: you look for additional insights and strategies. But, most of the time, when asked to generate more alternatives, people simply add one or two shallow alternatives to their initial insight. ...A new alternative should flow from a reconsideration of the facts of the situation, and it should also address the weaknesses of any already developed alternatives.
