In our search for measures of deliver performance that meet these criteria, we settled on four: delivery lead time, deployment frequency, time to restore service, and change fail rate. ... Software delivery performance impacts organizational performance and noncommercial performance.

<table class="table">
	<thead>
		<th>2017</th>
		<th>High Performers</th>
		<th>Medium Performers</th>
		<th>Low Performers</th>
	</thead>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<strong>Deployment Frequency</strong>
		</td>
		<td>
			On demand (multiple deploys per day)
		</td>
		<td>
			Between once per week and once per month
		</td>
		<td>
		  Between once per week and once per month

	<tr>
		<td>
			<strong>Lead Time for Changes</strong>

		<td>
			Less than one hour

We decided to select a model defined by sociologist Ron Westrum. ...

**Pathological** (power-oriented) organizations are characterized by alrge amounts of fear and threat. People often hoard information or withhold it for political reasons, or distort it to make themselves look better.

**Bureaucratic** (rule-oriented) organizations protect departments. Those in the department want to maintain their "turf", insist on their own rules, and generally do things by the book - _their_ book.

**Generative** (performance-oriented) organizations focus on the mission. How do we accomplish our goal? Everything is subordinated to good performance, to doing what we are supposed to do. 

An additional insight from Westrum was that this definition of organizational culture predicts performance outcomes.

We examined four capabilities which make up our model of a Lean approach to product development (see also Figure 8.1).

1. The extent to which teams slice up products and features into small batches that can be comleted in less than a week and released frequently, includeing the use of MVPs (minimum viable products)

1. Whether teams have a good understanding of the flow of work from the business all the way through to custoemrs, and whether they have visibility into this flow, including the status of products and features.

1. Whether organizations actively and regularly seek customer feedback and incorporate this feedback into the design of their products.

1. Whether development teams have the authority to create and change specifications as part of the development process without requiring approval.

Analysis shows that these factors were statisticallty significant in predicting high software delivery performance, as well as improving organizational culture and decreasing burnout.

As Andrew Stanton says, "There's a difference between criticism and constructive criticism. With the latter, you're constructing at the same time you're criticizing. You're building as you're breaking down, making new pieces to work with out of the stuff you've just ripped apart. That's an art form in itself. I always lfeel like whatever notes you're giving should inspire the recipient - like, 'How do I get that kid to want to redo his homework?' So, you've got to act like a teacher. Sometimes you talk about the problems in fifty different ways until you find that one sentence that you can see makre's their eyes pop, as if they're thinking, 'Oh, I want to do it.' Instead of saying, 'The writing in this scene isn't good enough,' you wsay, 'Don't you want people to walk out of the theater and be quoting those lines?' It's more of a challenge. 'Isn't this what you want? I want that too!'"

While the process was difficult and time consuming, Pete and his crew never believed that a failed approach meant that _they_ had failed. Instead, they saw that each idea led them a bit closer to finding the better option. And that allowed them to come to work each day engaged and excited, even while in the midst of confusion. This is key: When experimentation is seen as necessary and productive, not as a frustrating waste of time, people will enjoy their work, even when it is confounding to them. 

The principle I'm describing here - iterative trial and error - has long-recognized value in science. When scientists have a question, they construct hypotheses, test them, analyze them, and draw conclusions - and then they do it all over again. The reasoning behind this is simple: experiments are fact-finding missions that, over time, inch scientists toward greater understand. That means _any_ outcome is a good outcome, because it yields new information.

Another trick is to encourage people to play. "Some of the best ideas come out of joking around, which only comes when you (or the boss) give yourself permission to do it,", Pete says. ... "I've heard people describe creativity as 'unexpected connections between unrelated concepts or ideas.' If that's at all true, you have to bein a certain mindset to make thos econnections. So when I sense we're getting nowhere, I just shut things down. We all go off to something else. Later, once the mood has shifted, I'll attack the problem again."

Similarly, in Japanese Zen, that idea of not being constrained by what we already know is called "beginner's mind." ...

PAying attention to the present moment without letting your thoughts and ideas about the past and the future get in the way is essential. Why? Because it makes room for the views of others. It allows us to begin to trust them - and, more important, to _hear_ them. It makes us willing to experiment, and it makes it safe to try something that may fail. It encourages us to work on our awareness, trying to set up our own feedback loop in which paying attention improves our ability to pay attention. It requires us to understand that to advance creatively, we must let go of something. As the composer Philip Glass once said, "The real issue is not how do you find your voice but ... getting rid of the damn thing."
