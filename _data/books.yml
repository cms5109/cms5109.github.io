        quick_take: "Very interesting and accessible look into the evolving theories of why cancer originates and spreads. Very focused on a specific aspect of cancer, but if you're interested in that, then it's a good read."

        author: Jim VandeHei, Mike Allen, Roy Schwartz

        stars: 4
        quick_take: "Ended up being a little repetitive, but also clearly articulates why I've hated some jobs, and what I value in work. Product Manager can very easily be a bullshit job."

        stars: 5
        quick_take: "An incredibly detailed look into Robert Moses' career in public service, with some interesting notes about getting things done. I come away with a very mixed perception of Moses - disagree with his tactics/strategy, but he got things done."
     
      - title: "Zero To IPO"
        author: Frederic Kerrest

        quick_take: "Super tactical; a pretty good primer on a very specific topic, but I still had questions walking away from it."

        author: Siddhartha Mukherjee

        stars: 3
        quick_take: "A super informative and well-written book, but the topic is quite narrow. I'd recommend starting with The Emperor of All Maladies"

        finished: June 23, 2022
        stars: 5
        quick_take: "Breaks down each of the wars into 5 steps: Attack, Resistance, Clash, Closing the Net, Knowing When to Stop. Hearing about the great generals of antiquity is interesting, and the author offers a nuanced perspective, balancing praise for the general's leadership with plain luck. The biggest takeaway is the importance of 'audacity'."

        finished: June 16, 2022
        stars: 4
        quick_take: "Pretty technical deep dive into the US healthcare landscape. The focus on the individual policy proposals during the Trump administration was interesting, but felt less relevant now. The most important question: should better-off individuals help subsidize care for less fortunate ones?"
      
      - title: "The Fixer: My Adventures Saving Startups from Death by Politics"
        author: Bradley Tusk

        stars: 3
        quick_take: "At this point, it seems a bit dated, but it's interesting to see which predicitions came true (such as the rise of specialty/urgent care clinics). Some overall principles may hold true, but it's probably better to focus on 'jobs to be done' more holistically."
